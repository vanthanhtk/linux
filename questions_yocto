- difference add packet into yocto then build that packet and creat packet.rpm 
and install into core.

- when in building processes can I pause processes?

- warnings: "Failed to fetch URL http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.7.tar.bz2, attempting MIRRORS if available" 
    + Can I continue and ignore warning? 
    + Can I go to URL then download manual packet and put into poky folder?
    + If wouldn't download that packet then have affect to processes?
